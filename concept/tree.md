## Tree

A tree is non-linear and a hierarchical data structure consisting of a collection of nodes such that each node of the tree stores a value and a list of references to other nodes (the “children”).

## Terminologies

### Parent Node
The node which is a predecessor of a node.

### Child Node
The node which is the immediate successor of a node.

### Root Node
The topmost node of a tree or the node which does not have any parent node.
A non-empty tree must contain exactly one root node.
