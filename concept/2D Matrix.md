1. **Spiral Traversal**: Traversing a matrix in a spiral order, starting from the outer layer and moving inward.
2. **Boundary Traversal**: Traversing the boundary elements of a matrix, including top, right, bottom, and left edges.
3. **Diagonal Traversal**: Traversing a matrix diagonally, either from top-left to bottom-right or from top-right to bottom-left.
4. **Row-wise/Column-wise Traversal**: Traversing a matrix row by row or column by column.
5. **Transpose**: Swapping rows and columns of a matrix, effectively flipping it along its main diagonal.
6. **Rotation**: Rotating a matrix by 90 degrees (clockwise or counterclockwise).
7. **Flood Fill**: Propagating a value or color through connected cells in a matrix, typically using depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS).
8. **Dynamic Programming**: Using dynamic programming techniques to solve optimization problems on 2D matrices, such as finding the maximum sum, minimum cost, or longest path.
9. **Backtracking**: Using backtracking algorithms to explore all possible paths or configurations in a matrix, often used for permutation or combination problems.
10. **Binary Search**: Performing binary search on a sorted matrix, typically on rows or columns, to find a specific element or fulfill certain conditions.
