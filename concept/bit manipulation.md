1. Setting a bit: Use the OR operator (|) with a bitmask where the corresponding bit is set to 1.
2. Clearing a bit: Use the AND operator (&) with a bitmask where the corresponding bit is set to 0.
3. Flipping a bit: Use the XOR operator (^) with a bitmask where the corresponding bit is set to 1.
4. Checking if a bit is set: Use the AND operator (&) with a bitmask where only the corresponding bit is set, then check if the result is non-zero.
