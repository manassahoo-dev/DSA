Given an array, rotate the array to the right by `k` steps, where `k` is non-negative.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3
Output: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]

Explanation:
rotate 1 steps to the right: [7,1,2,3,4,5,6]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [6,7,1,2,3,4,5]
rotate 3 steps to the right: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [-1,-100,3,99], k = 2
Output: [3,99,-1,-100]

Explanation:
rotate 1 steps to the right: [99,-1,-100,3]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [3,99,-1,-100]
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
*   `-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1`
*   `0 <= k <= 105`

**Follow up:**

*   Try to come up with as many solutions as you can. There are at least **three** different ways to solve this problem.
*   Could you do it in-place with `O(1)` extra space?


**Solution Approach**

1. Reverse the whole array.
2. Reverse the array but will reverse only the elements who's index is less than k.
3. Reverse the array but will reverse only the elements who's index is k and greater than k.

```Java
class Solution {
    public void rotate(int[] nums, int k) {
        
        // step1: reverse the array
        // step2: split the array into two.
        // step3: reverse both the two parts.        
        //taking k modulo for edge cases
        
        k = k%nums.length;
        swap(nums, 0, nums.length-1);
        swap(nums, 0, k-1);
        swap(nums, k, nums.length-1);
    }
    public void swap(int[] arr, int start, int end){
        while(start<end){
            int temp = arr[start];
            arr[start] = arr[end];
            arr[end] = temp;
            start++;
            end--;
        }
    }
}
```
