Given an integer x, return true if x is a palindrome, and false otherwise.

 

**Example 1:**

```Input: x = 121
Output: true
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.
```
**Example 2:**

```Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
```
**Example 3:**

```Input: x = 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
```

**Constraints:**

- `231 <= x <= 231 - 1`
 

Follow up: Could you solve it without converting the integer to a string?

**Solution**
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isPalindrome(int x) {
        if(x < 0){
            return false;
        }else{
            int p = x;
            int number = 0;
            while(x > 0){
                int r = x % 10;
                x = x / 10;
                number = number * 10 + r;
            }
            return number == p;
        }
    }
}
```
