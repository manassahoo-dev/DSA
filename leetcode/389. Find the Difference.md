You are given two strings s and t.

String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.

Return the letter that was added to t.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "abcd", t = "abcde"
Output: "e"
Explanation: 'e' is the letter that was added.
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "", t = "y"
Output: "y"
``` 

**Constraints:**

- `0 <= s.length <= 1000`
- `t.length == s.length + 1`
- `s and t consist of lowercase English letters.`

**Solution**
```java
class Solution {
    public char findTheDifference(String s, String t) {
        char c = 0;
        for(char cs : s.toCharArray()) c ^= cs;
        for(char ct : t.toCharArray()) c ^= ct;
        return c;
    }
}
```
