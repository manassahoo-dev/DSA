| ----------- | ------ |----------- |
| [11,7,2,15] | 2      | The element 7 has the element 2 strictly smaller than it and the element 11 strictly greater than it.
Element 11 has element 7 strictly smaller than it and element 15 strictly greater than it.
In total there are 2 elements having both a strictly smaller and a strictly greater element appear in nums.|
| [-3,3,3,90] | 2      | The element 3 has the element -3 strictly smaller than it and the element 90 strictly greater than it.
