## [2148. Count Elements With Strictly Smaller and Greater Elements](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-elements-with-strictly-smaller-and-greater-elements/)

Given an integer array nums, return the number of elements that have both a strictly smaller and a strictly greater element appear in nums.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [11,7,2,15]
Output: 2

Explanation: 
The element 7 has the element 2 strictly smaller than it and the element 11 strictly greater than it.
Element 11 has element 7 strictly smaller than it and element 15 strictly greater than it.
In total there are 2 elements having both a strictly smaller and a strictly greater element appear in nums.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [-3,3,3,90]
Output: 2

Explanation: 
The element 3 has the element -3 strictly smaller than it and the element 90 strictly greater than it.
Since there are two elements with the value 3, in total there are 2 elements having both a strictly smaller and a strictly greater element appear in nums.
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 100`
*   `-105 <= nums[i] <= 105`

```Java
class Solution {
    public int countElements(int[] nums) {
        int nmin=Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int nmax=Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        for(int a:nums) {
            nmin=Math.min(a,nmin);
            nmax=Math.max(a,nmax);
        }
        
        int count=0;
        for(int a:nums) {
            if(a>nmin && a<nmax){
                count++;                
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```
