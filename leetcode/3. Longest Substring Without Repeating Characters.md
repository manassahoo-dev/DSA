Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

Example 1:

Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
Example 2:

Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
Example 3:

Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.

```java
public class Solution {
    public int lengthOfLongestSubstring(String s) {
        Map<Character, Integer> chars = new HashMap();

        int left = 0;
        int right = 0;

        int res = 0;
        while (right < s.length()) {
            char r = s.charAt(right);
            chars.put(r, chars.getOrDefault(r,0) + 1);
            
            while (chars.get(r) > 1) {
                char l = s.charAt(left);
                chars.put(l, chars.get(l) - 1);
                left++;
            }

            res = Math.max(res, right - left + 1);

            right++;
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
