The JavaScript call stack is a data structure used by the JavaScript engine to keep track of function calls in a program. 
When a function is called, a new frame is created on the stack, which contains the function's arguments and local variables. 
When the function returns, its frame is removed from the stack.

Here are some key points about the JavaScript call stack:

- The call stack is a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure, which means that the last function added to the stack is the first one to be removed.
- The call stack can be thought of as a stack of function calls. When a new function is called, it is added to the top of the stack. When a function returns, it is removed from the top of the stack.
- The call stack has a finite size, and if it becomes too large, the program may crash with a stack overflow error.
