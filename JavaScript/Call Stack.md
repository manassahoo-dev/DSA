The JavaScript call stack is a data structure used by the JavaScript engine to keep track of function calls in a program. 
When a function is called, a new frame is created on the stack, which contains the function's arguments and local variables. 
When the function returns, its frame is removed from the stack.

Here are some key points about the JavaScript call stack:

- The call stack is a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure, which means that the last function added to the stack is the first one to be removed.
- The call stack can be thought of as a stack of function calls. When a new function is called, it is added to the top of the stack. When a function returns, it is removed from the top of the stack.
- The call stack has a finite size, and if it becomes too large, the program may crash with a stack overflow error.

Here is an example code snippet to demonstrate the call stack in action:
```js
function foo() {
  console.log('foo');
}

function bar() {
  foo();
  console.log('bar');
}

function baz() {
  bar();
  console.log('baz');
}

baz();
```

In this example, we have three functions: foo(), bar(), and baz(). The baz() function calls the bar() function, which in turn calls the foo() function. Each function logs a message to the console when it is called.

Here is a diagram of the call stack as the program executes:

|          |
|    foo   |
|----------|
|    bar   |
|----------|
|    baz   |
|----------|

When the baz() function is called, it is added to the top of the stack. Then, bar() is called from baz(), and is added to the top of the stack. Finally, foo() is called from bar(), and is added to the top of the stack.

When foo() returns, it is removed from the top of the stack. Then, bar() returns and is removed from the stack. Finally, baz() returns and is removed from the stack.
