Strict mode is a feature introduced in `ECMAScript 5 (ES5)` that allows developers to opt-in to a stricter set of rules and restrictions when writing JavaScript code. 
When `'use strict'` is added at the beginning of a script or a function, it activates strict mode for that particular scope.

The primary purpose of strict mode is to address some of the problematic and error-prone aspects of the JavaScript language, promoting safer and more predictable behavior. It helps developers write cleaner and more robust code by throwing errors for common mistakes, disallowing certain language features, and preventing potentially hazardous practices.

Some of the key behaviors enforced by strict mode include:

**1. No Implicit Global Variables:**

In strict mode, variables must be explicitly declared using the var, let, or const keywords. Attempting to assign a value to an undeclared variable will result in an error, preventing accidental global variable creation.

**2. Restricted Use of Reserved Words:**

Strict mode prohibits using certain words reserved for future versions of JavaScript, avoiding potential conflicts when new language features are introduced.

**3. Preventing 'this' Coercion:** 

In strict mode, the value of 'this' is not automatically coerced to the global object when a function is called without any context. Instead, 'this' remains undefined in such cases, highlighting possible context-related issues.

**4. No Duplicate Parameters:** 

Functions in strict mode cannot have duplicate parameter names, eliminating ambiguity and potential errors caused by reusing parameter names.

**5. Restricted 'eval' and 'arguments' Usage:** 

Strict mode makes 'eval' and 'arguments' behave more securely and predictably, preventing accidental variable leaks and ensuring that 'arguments' does not reflect parameter changes.

**6. No Octal Numeric Literals:** 

Numeric literals with a leading zero, which would be interpreted as octal numbers in non-strict mode, are not allowed in strict mode. This reduces confusion and ensures consistent behavior across environments.

**7. No Deleting Immutable Properties:** 

Deleting properties that are non-configurable (e.g., built-in JavaScript properties) results in an error in strict mode, promoting a safer and more robust codebase.

**8. No Duplicate Object Properties:** 

Defining multiple properties with the same name in an object literal or using the 'Object.defineProperty' method with the same property name throws an error in strict mode.

Strict mode helps developers catch common mistakes, encourages better coding practices, and prepares code for future JavaScript versions. It is recommended to use strict mode in all modern JavaScript projects to enhance code quality and maintainability.
