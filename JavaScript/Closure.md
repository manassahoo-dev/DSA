JavaScript closures are an essential concept in understanding the behavior of functions and their access to variables. Simply put, a closure is a function that remembers the variables in its scope even when the function is executed outside that scope.

In JavaScript, functions have access to variables defined in their outer scope. When a function is defined inside another function, it forms a closure. This means that the inner function has access to the variables and parameters of its outer function, even after the outer function has finished executing.

Here's an example to illustrate the concept:
```js
function outerFunction() {
  var outerVariable = 'I am outer';

  function innerFunction() {
    console.log(outerVariable); // Accessing the outer variable
  }

  return innerFunction;
}

var closureFunction = outerFunction(); // Assigning the inner function to a variable
closureFunction(); // Calling the inner function

```
